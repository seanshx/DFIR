#Incident responders can use this to hunt across a file system #to find things the attacker may have changed. For example, if #you think an attack took place in the last week, you can run:

find / -mtime -7

#This will return every file with a modification date in the last 7 days.

Attacker behaviour and profiling

To finish off, we are going to look at some of the more common files you should check as you profile a suspect system:
/etc/hosts: this shows any static IP assignments and can identify attackers trying to create routes in plain sight.
/etc/passwd: Look for unexpected accounts, especially UID 0 accounts.
/etc/shadow: Look for any unexpected modification which may indicate attackers have changed a legitimate password.
/etc/sudoers: shows users with the ability to run commands with elevated privileges.
c: check for changes to group memberships. GID27 is traditionally the SUDOERS group so special attention needs to paid here.
(user path)/.ssh/authorized_keys: Check to see if anything has been added. Attackers add keys to maintain access.
/etc/inittab: Attackers can add code here to have it execute when initd restarts.
Directory names starting with .: This is a technique to try and hide entire directories where the attacker can store tools/data.
Regular files in /dev: The /dev folder should hold devices. If you find any regular files in there its worth a closer look.
